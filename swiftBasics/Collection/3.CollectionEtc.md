## Swift Naming Guide
---
### Array vs Set
- Both of them are Data Collection
1. Array has order, Set doesnt
2. Array is more frequently used on real Project

- Array, Dic, Set are "Swift Collection"
    + Struct, Value Type
    + let, var -> mutable, unmutable
    + only have One Type Value in one Collection
    + **KeyValuePairs**? 
- there are more Collections Like "Foundation Collection"
    + Class, Object Type
        * only Object Type Data is can be saved
    + its decided when its created whether mutable or not
    + NSArray, NSDictionary, NSSet // NSMutableArray, NSMutableDictionary, NSMutableSet
    + Can have variety of Type Values in one Collection

### KeyValuePairs
- Dictionary-like with order
```swift
let introduce: KeyValuePairs = ["first" : "Hello", "second": "My Name", "third": "is"]
print(introduce[2].0)  // third. look at subscript index. its index number
```
---
### Copy-On-Write
```swift
var array = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] // it has own memory space
var sub = array[0...2] // [1,2,3] // in this case, this 'sub' arr might use 'array's partial memory space
```
- 메모리를 절약하기 위해 하나의 메모리 값을 공유하여 내부적으로 처리하는 매커니즘이 있음
